Sorts your movies into folders based on IMDB rating

This will sort your movies into folders based on the IMDB rating.
First of all, put all your movies into a single folder.

Next take the movie.cmd and paste it into your "send to" folder. 
Simply type 'shell:sendto' in your address bar and paste it in there.

Now when you right click any file, you'll see an additional option 'send to movie.cmd'

Next copy the movie.py file to your C drive.

Finally right click the folder containing all your movies and send it to movie.cmd.

Wait a few minutes and finally you'll see that all your movies have been sorted based on the IMDB rating.
